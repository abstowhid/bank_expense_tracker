# Deposit and Withdrawal System

This is a simple JavaScript-based project that allows users to deposit and withdraw money while keeping track of the total balance, deposits, and withdrawals.

## Features

- **Deposit Function**: Allows users to deposit an amount, which adds to the total balance and total deposit.
- **Withdraw Function**: Allows users to withdraw an amount, which subtracts from the total balance and adds to the total withdrawals.
- **Validation**: Ensures that only positive numbers are entered, and prevents withdrawals exceeding the available balance.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the deposit and withdrawal system in action.

## How It Works

- The user can input the amount they want to deposit or withdraw.
- The total balance, total deposits, and total withdrawals are displayed dynamically on the page.
- The deposit function increases the balance and deposit count.
- The withdraw function decreases the balance and increases the withdrawal count, while checking if the user has enough balance to make the withdrawal.

## Example Use Case

- If a user deposits $50, the total balance will increase by $50, and the deposit count will reflect the $50.
- If the user tries to withdraw $100 but only has $50 in the balance, an alert will notify them that the withdrawal cannot proceed.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Ensure you have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
2. Open `index.html` to interact with the deposit and withdrawal system.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the basic structure.
- **CSS** for styling (if included).
- **JavaScript** for the functionality behind deposits and withdrawals.
